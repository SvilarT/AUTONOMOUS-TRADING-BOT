# Architecture Map

This document maps the current system architecture for the Autonomous Trading Bot. It is intended to be the canonical high-level reference for contributors before making execution, risk, ledger, or live-trading changes.

## Current System Status

The system is a FastAPI + MongoDB backend with a React dashboard frontend.

The autonomous bot path is paper/simulation execution only:

```text
BotManager -> BotEngine -> ExecutionServiceV2 -> TradingServiceV2 -> PaperExecutionAdapterV2
```

Manual live-trading endpoints exist separately and are intentionally routed through a fail-closed gate:

```text
/api/live-trading/* -> LiveTradingServiceV2 -> LiveTradingGateV2 -> CoinbaseLiveExecutionAdapterV2
```

Live autonomous trading is not implemented. `TradingModeService.assert_can_trade()` rejects normal bot execution when `TRADING_MODE=live-trading`; real order submission must use `LiveTradingServiceV2`.

## Backend Entry Points

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `backend/server.py` | ASGI entry point; exposes `app = create_app()` |
| `backend/app_factory.py` | Creates FastAPI app, health/readiness endpoints, router inclusion, CORS middleware |
| `backend/app_state.py` | Loads `.env`, configures logging, creates Mongo client/db handle, password context, auth bearer, and starts `BotManager` during lifespan |
| `backend/api_routes.py` | Re-exports current router from `api_routes_v3` |
| `backend/api_routes_v2.py` | Core auth/dashboard/bot/portfolio/risk endpoints |
| `backend/api_routes_v3.py` | Backtest, ledger, live-readonly, gated live-trading, and ops endpoints |

---

## Frontend Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    App[frontend/src/App.js]
    Auth[Auth Component]
    Dashboard[Dashboard Component]
    LocalStorage[(localStorage token/user)]
    API[/REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL/api/]

    App --> Auth
    App --> Dashboard
    App --> LocalStorage
    Auth -->|signup/login| API
    Dashboard -->|poll every 10s| API
    LocalStorage -->|Axios Authorization interceptor| API
```

### Frontend behavior

- `App.js` reads `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` and exports `API` as `${BACKEND_URL}/api`.
- Axios attaches `Authorization: Bearer <token>` from `localStorage` to requests.
- `Dashboard.js` polls dashboard, trades, positions, risk metrics, and bot config every 10 seconds.
- Bot start/stop is controlled through `/api/bot/start` and `/api/bot/stop`.

        alt kill switch triggered

            Portfolio->>DB: update positions/state/trades/risk
            Engine->>Lock: release lock
        end
    end
```

### Invariants

- Bot execution must remain on `ExecutionServiceV2 -> TradingServiceV2`.
- `TradingServiceV2` delegates to `PaperExecutionAdapterV2`.
- Normal bot execution must not call `CoinbaseLiveExecutionAdapterV2`.
- `TradingModeService.assert_can_trade()` blocks normal execution in `live-readonly` and `live-trading` modes.
- Risk kill switches must be evaluated before order planning/execution.
- Execution locks and idempotency keys protect against duplicate paper orders.

        Coinbase-->>Adapter: order response
        Service->>Audit: append exchange response audit
        Service-->>Client: order result
    end
```

### Live-trading gates

Live orders are fail-closed unless all required conditions pass:

- `TRADING_MODE=live-trading`
- `LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED=True`
- `LIVE_EXECUTION_ADAPTER=coinbase_exchange_v2`
- user bot config has `live_trading_enabled=True`
- symbol is allowlisted
- notional is positive and below max order notional
- manual approval passes when required
- adapter-level kill switch is not enabled

## Portfolio, Ledger, and Accounting Model

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    ExecutionResult[Execution Result]
    Trades[(trades_v2)]
    Positions[(positions_v2)]
    State[(portfolio_state)]
    Ledger[(ledger_entries)]
    Risk[(risk_metrics)]
    Reports[(reconciliation_reports)]

    ExecutionResult -->|record_trade_attempt| Trades
    ExecutionResult -->|record_buy_fill / record_sell_fill| Positions
    ExecutionResult -->|cash/PnL deltas| State
    ExecutionResult -->|append events| Ledger
    State --> Risk
    Positions --> Risk
    Ledger -->|rebuild| Reports
    State -->|compare| Reports
    Positions -->|compare| Reports
```

### Ledger event model

| Event | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `BUY_FILL` | Base acquired and cash spent |
| `SELL_FILL` | Base sold and net cash received |
| `REALIZED_PNL` | Realized profit/loss event for sell fills |
| `FEE` | Fee accounting event |

### Read models

| Collection | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `portfolio_state` | Fast account-level cash/equity/PnL read model |
| `positions_v2` | Fast per-symbol open-position read model |
| `trades_v2` | Trade-attempt/fill history |
| `risk_metrics` | Time-series risk snapshots |
| `ledger_entries` | Append-only accounting source of truth |
| `reconciliation_reports` | Ledger/read-model consistency reports |

## Market Data Model

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    MarketDataService[MarketDataService]
    Sim[Seeded Simulation]
    Coinbase[Coinbase Exchange Ticker/Candles]
    Candles[(market_candles)]
    Bot[BotEngine]
    Backtest[BacktestingServiceV2]

    MarketDataService -->|SIMULATION_MODE=true| Sim
    MarketDataService -->|SIMULATION_MODE=false| Coinbase
    MarketDataService --> Candles
    Bot --> MarketDataService
    Backtest --> MarketDataService
```

The service supports both current ticker retrieval and candle retrieval. In simulation mode it generates deterministic seeded synthetic prices/candles. In non-simulation mode it fetches Coinbase Exchange ticker/candle data and fails closed when data is unavailable.

## Safety Boundaries

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph PaperBoundary[Paper / Autonomous Boundary]
        BotEngine --> ExecutionServiceV2 --> TradingServiceV2 --> PaperExecutionAdapterV2
    end

    subgraph LiveBoundary[Manual Live Boundary]
        LiveRoutes[/api/live-trading/*/] --> LiveTradingServiceV2 --> LiveTradingGateV2 --> CoinbaseLiveExecutionAdapterV2
    end

    TradingModeService --> BotEngine
    TradingModeService --> LiveTradingServiceV2
    CoinbaseLiveExecutionAdapterV2 --> KillSwitch[COINBASE_LIVE_ORDER_KILL_SWITCH]
    LiveTradingServiceV2 --> LiveOrderAuditServiceV2
```

### Critical safety rules

1. Do not inject `CoinbaseLiveExecutionAdapterV2` into `ExecutionServiceV2` or `TradingServiceV2`.
2. Do not allow autonomous bot cycles to submit live orders.
3. Preserve `TradingModeService.assert_can_trade()` semantics.
4. Keep live execution behind `LiveTradingServiceV2` and `LiveTradingGateV2`.
5. Keep `dry_run=True` default for live-trading request models.
6. Preserve adapter-level kill switch behavior.
7. Preserve hash-chained audits for every live order preflight and adapter result.
8. Preserve ledger/read-model reconciliation tests when modifying accounting.

## Known Architectural Debt

These are not necessarily bugs, but they are the next design pressure points:

1. **Global app state:** database/auth/bot manager are module-level globals, which makes isolated testing and multi-instance deployment harder.
2. **Route modules import services directly:** dependency injection is limited; test seams are manual.
3. **Frontend stores JWT in localStorage:** convenient, but weaker than secure cookie/session architecture for production.
4. **Bot manager starts with API process:** production should separate API and worker processes or add leader election.
5. **No formal domain layer:** trading, accounting, risk, execution, and persistence are service-based but not yet strict clean architecture.
6. **Live endpoints lack role/MFA boundary:** authenticated user is enough today; production live execution should require stronger authorization.
7. **Market data is service-local:** no explicit market-data freshness SLA or cache policy beyond stored candles.
8. **No formal event bus:** workflows are synchronous service calls; future scale may need queued jobs/events.

    Worker --> Observability
    APIGateway --> Observability
```

Target evolution:

- Split API server and bot worker.
- Move from module-level globals to explicit dependency wiring.
- Introduce stronger domain models for orders, fills, positions, ledger events, risk decisions, and execution decisions.
- Add event queue for bot cycles and reconciliation jobs.
- Move live trading to scoped authorization + MFA + signed approval challenge.
- Add observability with structured metrics, traces, and alert policies.

## Contributor Checklist

Before changing execution, risk, or ledger code:

- [ ] Does this preserve autonomous paper-only execution?
