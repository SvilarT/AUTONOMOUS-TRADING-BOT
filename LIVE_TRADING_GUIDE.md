# Live Trading Setup Guide

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Read Before Enabling Live Trading

Live trading involves **real money and real risk**. The bot will execute trades with actual funds. Please ensure you:
- Understand the risks involved
- Have tested thoroughly in simulation mode
- Start with small amounts
- Monitor the bot closely during initial live trading

---

## Current Status

✅ **Simulation Mode Active** - Trading with virtual $10,000  
✅ **Bot Manager Running** - Autonomous trading cycles operational  
✅ **GPT-5 Analysis Working** - Real-time market intelligence  
✅ **Risk Management Active** - Capital floor and loss limits enforced

---

## Switch to Live Trading

### Step 1: Obtain Coinbase Advanced Trade API Credentials

1. Go to https://www.coinbase.com/developer-platform/products/advanced-trade-api
2. Sign in to your Coinbase account
3. Navigate to **API Keys** section
4. Click **"Create API Key"**

**Critical Settings:**
- **Signature Algorithm**: Select **ECDSA (ES256)** ⚠️ NOT Ed25519
- **Permissions**: Enable "View" and "Trade"
- **IP Allowlist**: Add your server's IP for security (optional but recommended)
- **API Key Nickname**: "Trading Bot - Production"

5. Click "Create"
6. **IMMEDIATELY SAVE**:
   - API Key ID (format: `organizations/{org_id}/apiKeys/{key_id}`)
   - Private Key (EC Private Key in PEM format)

⚠️ The private key is shown **only once** and cannot be recovered!

---

### Step 2: Update Environment Configuration

Edit `/app/backend/.env`:

```bash
# Open the file
nano /app/backend/.env
```

**Update these lines:**

```env
# Coinbase Credentials (Replace with your real keys)
COINBASE_API_KEY=organizations/YOUR_ORG_ID/apiKeys/YOUR_KEY_ID
COINBASE_API_SECRET=-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
MIGHAgEAMBMGByqGSM49AgEGCCqGSM49AwEHBG0wawIBAQQg...
YOUR_ACTUAL_PRIVATE_KEY_CONTENT_HERE...
-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----

# Trading Mode (Change to False for live trading)
SIMULATION_MODE=False
```

**Important Notes:**
- Keep the `-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----` lines
- Preserve all newlines in the private key
- Ensure proper indentation
- Save the file (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X in nano)

---

### Step 3: Restart Backend Service

```bash
sudo supervisorctl restart backend
```

Wait 5 seconds, then verify the bot started correctly:

```bash
tail -n 50 /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log
```

Look for:
- ✅ "Coinbase client initialized for live trading"
- ❌ "Running in simulation mode" (should NOT appear if done correctly)

---

### Step 4: Fund Your Account

**Before the bot can trade:**

1. Log into Coinbase
2. Deposit USD to your trading account
3. Recommended starting amount: $500 - $2,000
4. The bot uses **exchange wallet** - funds stay on Coinbase

**Risk Parameters (configured in .env):**
- Capital Floor: 97% (bot stops if equity drops below $9,700 per $10,000)
- Max Daily Loss: 1.5% ($150 per $10,000)
- Max Position Size: 5% of equity per trade

---

### Step 5: Activate Live Trading

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Log in to your account
3. Toggle the bot to "Running"
4. The bot will now execute **real trades** with **real money**

---

## Monitoring Live Trading

### Real-Time Monitoring

**Dashboard Metrics:**
- Total Equity (updates with every trade)
- Active Positions (open trades)
- Total Trades (executed count)
- Current Drawdown (risk indicator)

**AI Analysis Tab:**
- GPT-5 market analysis
- Regime classification
- Confidence scores
- Risk factors

### Backend Logs

```bash
# View live trading activity
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log

# Look for:
# - "Trade executed: [SYMBOL] BUY/SELL $[AMOUNT]"
# - "Trade not approved: [REASON]"
# - Risk validation messages
```

### Check Coinbase Account

1. Log into Coinbase
2. Go to **Orders** section
3. Verify trades appear in Coinbase order history
4. Check your portfolio balance matches dashboard

---

## Safety Features

The bot includes multiple layers of protection:

### 1. Capital Floor Protection
- **Threshold**: 97% of all-time high equity
- **Action**: Trading halts if breached
- **Example**: If max equity was $10,000, trading stops if it drops to $9,700

### 2. Daily Loss Limit
- **Threshold**: 1.5% daily loss
- **Action**: Automatic trading halt
- **Example**: Max $150 loss per day on $10,000 capital

### 3. Position Sizing
- **Max per trade**: 5% of total equity
- **Method**: Kelly Criterion with 0.25x safety factor
- **Example**: Max $500 trade on $10,000 capital

### 4. Confidence Threshold
- **Minimum**: 60% confidence required
- **Source**: GPT-5 analysis
- **Action**: Rejects trades below threshold

### 5. Cost Validation
- **Check**: Slippage and execution costs
- **Action**: Rejects high-cost trades
- **Protection**: Prevents excessive fees

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Executing Trades

**Check 1: API Credentials**
```bash
grep "COINBASE_API_KEY" /app/backend/.env
grep "SIMULATION_MODE" /app/backend/.env
```
- Verify API key format is correct
- Ensure SIMULATION_MODE=False

**Check 2: Backend Logs**
```bash
tail -n 100 /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log | grep -i error
```
- Look for authentication errors
- Check for API permission errors

**Check 3: Account Balance**
- Verify USD balance in Coinbase
- Ensure sufficient funds for trades
- Check trading permissions enabled

### Authentication Errors

**Error: "Invalid API key format"**
- Solution: Verify key format includes `organizations/{org_id}/apiKeys/{key_id}`

**Error: "Invalid signature"**
- Solution: Ensure ECDSA key was selected, not Ed25519
- Verify private key has proper newlines

**Error: "Insufficient permissions"**
- Solution: Recreate API key with "Trade" permission enabled

### Trades Not Appearing in Dashboard

**Refresh the page** - Dashboard polls every 10 seconds

**Check API endpoint:**
```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"your@email.com","password":"yourpassword"}' \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['access_token'])")

curl -s -X GET "http://localhost:8001/api/trades" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

---

## Risk Management Best Practices

### Start Small
- Begin with $500-$1,000
- Increase gradually after successful weeks
- Never risk more than you can afford to lose

### Monitor Closely
- Check dashboard 2-3 times daily
- Review AI analysis reasoning
- Watch for unusual market conditions

### Set Alerts (Optional)
- Consider adding email/SMS notifications for:
  - Large trades (>$100)
  - Daily loss approaching limit
  - Capital floor warnings

### Regular Review
- Weekly: Review P&L and trade quality
- Monthly: Analyze strategy performance
- Quarterly: Assess risk parameter effectiveness

---

## Switching Back to Simulation

To return to simulation mode:

1. Edit `/app/backend/.env`
2. Change `SIMULATION_MODE=False` to `SIMULATION_MODE=True`
3. Restart backend: `sudo supervisorctl restart backend`
4. Bot will resume using simulated data

---

## Emergency Stop

**To immediately halt all trading:**

1. Click the bot toggle to "Stopped" in dashboard, OR
2. Run: 
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/bot/stop \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

The bot will complete any in-progress analysis but will not execute new trades.
