# Production Roadmap

This roadmap defines the path from the current paper/simulation prototype to a production-grade trading system. It is intentionally gate-based: a phase is not complete until its acceptance criteria and operational evidence are satisfied.

## Current Baseline

The repository currently has:

- FastAPI backend with MongoDB persistence.
- React dashboard frontend.
- JWT-based authentication.
- Paper/simulation autonomous bot execution.
- Gated manual live Coinbase execution endpoints.
- Live-readonly Coinbase integration.
- Portfolio, ledger, reconciliation, risk, backtesting, alerts, and operational readiness services.
- P0 live-trading hardening.
- Runtime bug-fix pass.
- Architecture map.
- Initial security-hardening pass.

The system is **not production-ready for autonomous live trading**. The safe current operating mode is paper/simulation.

---

## Production Philosophy

Production readiness is not a single deployment event. It requires evidence across six dimensions:

1. **Correctness** — accounting, ledger, execution, and reconciliation are deterministic and test-proven.
2. **Safety** — live execution is fail-closed, approval-gated, and bounded by hard risk controls.
3. **Security** — access, secrets, sessions, infrastructure, and privileged operations are hardened.
4. **Reliability** — the bot survives restarts, partial failures, market-data outages, and duplicate execution attempts.
5. **Observability** — every material decision and state transition is auditable.
6. **Operability** — deployment, rollback, incident response, and kill-switch procedures are documented and rehearsed.

## P1 — Paper Production Candidate

### Goal

Make the paper bot deployable as a stable production-style service with no live order risk.

### Engineering Work

- Split runtime roles:
  - API server
  - bot worker
  - scheduled reconciliation worker
- Add GitHub Actions CI:
  - backend pytest
  - frontend build
  - linting
  - dependency audit
  - secret scanning
- Add typed settings module using `pydantic-settings` or equivalent.
- Add structured app configuration report with redacted secrets.
- Add database migration/index bootstrap command separate from normal request path.
- Add API request IDs/correlation IDs.
- Add centralized error schema.
- Add frontend API error handling normalization.
- Add production Dockerfiles and compose profile.
- Add explicit `paper` deployment profile.

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all pure domain logic.
- Integration tests for:
  - auth
  - bot config
  - bot start/stop
  - paper buy/sell flow
  - ledger reconciliation
  - risk kill switch
  - market-data unavailable path
- End-to-end smoke test:
  - signup
  - start bot
  - allow one cycle
  - verify trade attempt / position / ledger / risk snapshot
  - stop bot
- Minimum backend coverage target: 80% initially, then 90%.

### Acceptance Criteria

- `TRADING_MODE=paper` is the only order-producing autonomous mode.
- CI passes on every PR.
- App can be deployed from clean environment using documented commands.
- Restarting the app does not duplicate orders.
- Paper ledger reconciliation passes after bot cycles.
- `/readyz?strict=true` fails if config is unsafe.

---

## P2 — Live-ReadOnly Candidate

### Goal

Use live exchange account and market data without permitting order submission.

### Engineering Work

- Harden Coinbase readonly adapter:
  - request timeouts
  - retry policy for idempotent reads only
  - response schema validation
  - credential redaction
  - explicit error taxonomy
- Add live-readonly reconciliation schedule.
- Store exchange snapshots with immutable metadata:
  - adapter version
  - credential alias, not raw credential
  - request timestamp
  - response timestamp
  - checksum/hash
- Add freshness SLA for market data and account snapshots.
- Add drift reports between internal state and exchange state.
- Add alerts for:
  - stale market data
  - failed exchange read
  - reconciliation mismatch
  - missing credentials

### Testing Requirements

- Mocked Coinbase readonly integration tests.
- Contract tests for expected response shape.
- Failure-path tests for:
  - 401/403 credentials error
  - 429 rate limit
  - 5xx exchange outage
  - malformed exchange response
  - stale data

### Acceptance Criteria

- `TRADING_MODE=live-readonly` cannot place orders through any autonomous path.
- Live-readonly endpoints work with redacted logs.
- Reconciliation report is generated and persisted.
- Readonly failures alert without crashing the API or worker.

---

## P3 — Manual Live Pilot

### Goal

Permit extremely small human-approved live orders through gated endpoints only.

### Engineering Work

- Replace static approval token with signed approval challenge:
  - server creates approval challenge
  - operator signs/approves challenge
  - approval expires within minutes
  - approval binds user, side, symbol, notional, and nonce
- Add MFA requirement for live-order approval.
- Add scoped authorization:
  - `trading:live-preview`
  - `trading:live-execute`
  - `ops:halt`
  - `ops:indexes`
- Add explicit live-order state machine:
  - requested
  - gate_checked
  - approved
  - submitted
  - acknowledged
  - filled/partially_filled/rejected/canceled
  - reconciled
- Add broker response normalization and schema validation.
- Add no-blind-retry policy for order submission.
- Add idempotency/client-order-ID collision tests.
- Add live-order reconciliation after every submitted order.
- Add operator runbook for manual live pilot.

### Risk Caps

Default pilot caps:

- Max order notional: `$5–$25`
- Max daily submitted notional: `$25–$100`
- Allowed symbols: `BTC-USD`, `ETH-USD`
- Market orders only if explicit pilot decision accepts slippage risk.
- Adapter kill switch enabled by default; disable only during approved test window.

### Testing Requirements

- Full mocked live-order integration suite.
- Dry-run tests prove no exchange POST occurs.
- Kill-switch tests prove POST is blocked at adapter boundary.
- Approval challenge tests:
  - expired approval fails
  - wrong symbol fails
  - wrong side fails
  - wrong notional fails
  - replayed approval fails
- Reconciliation tests after simulated live order response.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Every live order has a hash-chained audit trail.
- Every live order is reconciled against exchange state.
- Operator can trigger emergency halt.
- Unauthorized user cannot access live execution.
- Actual live execution is impossible without explicit approval, passing gate, passing risk check, and disabled kill switch.

---

## P4 — Constrained Autonomous Pilot

### Goal

Permit autonomous live execution only under hard caps, strict observability, and emergency rollback.

### Engineering Work

- Create a separate `LiveAutonomousExecutionService`; do not mutate paper execution into live execution.
- Add risk-decision ledger entries before every autonomous live order.
- Add pre-trade invariant checks:
  - mode
  - user authorization
  - strategy allowlist
  - symbol allowlist
  - position cap
  - exposure cap
  - daily loss cap
  - daily order count cap
  - stale data check
  - reconciliation freshness check
  - kill-switch check
- Add strategy versioning and immutable strategy snapshots.
- Add deterministic replay of bot decisions from historical data and stored state.
- Add worker leader election or single-runner enforcement.
- Add incident-level alerts:
  - duplicate order attempt
  - order rejected
  - unexpected fill
  - reconciliation mismatch
  - drawdown threshold
  - market data stale
  - live gate changed

### Risk Caps

Initial autonomous live pilot caps:

- Max order notional: low single digits to `$25`.
- Max gross exposure: very low fixed dollar amount.
- Max daily loss: hard dollar and percentage cap.
- Max daily order count: single digits.
- Strategy allowlist: one strategy version only.
- Trading window: limited hours only.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Autonomous live execution is opt-in per user and per strategy.
- All pre-trade checks are persisted with decision snapshots.
- No order can submit without fresh reconciliation.
- Every order reconciles or triggers halt.
- Kill switch can disable live autonomous execution immediately.
- Recovery from process restart cannot duplicate orders.

### Engineering Work

- Formal domain model package:
  - Order
  - Fill
  - Position
  - LedgerEntry
  - RiskDecision
  - StrategySignal
  - ExecutionDecision
- Durable event log as source of truth.
- Read-model rebuild tooling.
- Postgres or event-store evaluation for transactional guarantees.

  - rollback automation
  - migration discipline
  - environment parity
- Operational governance:
  - daily reconciliation review
  - strategy approval process
  - incident response drills
  - risk committee/operator signoff

### Acceptance Criteria
